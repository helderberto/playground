# Helder Codes

> This repository is dedicated to studies, practicing and useful codes that I've made using different languages on the past years.

You will find here codes like:

- Practices;
- Studies;
- Usefulls;

Note: Some implementations will be not finished beucase it's just to understand paradigms and concepts.
